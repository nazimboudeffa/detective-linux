# DISCLAIMER

Detective Linux is a Linux distribution made for cybersecurity originally was a work I have made for rebooting the blackbuntu distribution that has finally not gone in the right way.

This distribution is made by me to let you understand how to secure your information systems, it means it is used only for this purpose and not for any form of piracy.

You have to use it in this sense otherwise we are not responsible for any other use.

If you don't know what you are doing please STOP! And don't open an issue to tell me that it has errased your folders or has crashed your computer.

Please read the script and everything will be okey.
